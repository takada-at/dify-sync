## Initial Setup

### 1. Configuration

Begin by configuring your Dify API settings. Launch dify-sync and navigate to the Settings section to configure your API key and URL.

```bash
dify-sync
 üîÑ DIFY SYNC ‚Ä¢ Knowledge Base Synchronization


 MAIN MENU

    üì§ Upload files to Dify
    üì• Download files from Dify
  ‚ùØ ‚öôÔ∏è Settings (Configure API credentials and preferences)
    üö™ Exit
```

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration

Alternatively, you can specify configuration values using environment variables.

```
DIFY_API_URL=https://api.dify.ai/v1/
DIFY_API_KEY=dataset-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DIFY_DATASET_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### How to Retrieve Configuration Values

Follow these steps to obtain the required configuration values:

1. DIFY_API_KEY - Access the "API" tab in the Dify dataset interface and copy the Dataset API Key.
2. DIFY_DATASET_ID - This can be extracted from the dataset's URL or found in the API interface. The value `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx` in `datasets/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx/documents` represents the dataset's unique identifier.
3. DIFY_API_URL - Typically `https://api.dify.ai/v1/`. For custom servers, use the URL provided by your system administrator. Note that the path should normally include the `/v1/` prefix.
